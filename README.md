>The Eth to $4k POAP was a pretty big hit here, and the EthStaker team is REALLY excited about distributing an Eth to $5k POAP. The problem is that POAP is clamping down on POAP farmers, so we needed a new approach. We've decided to offer "Eth to $5k" POAPs to anyone who makes any donation to EthStaker.eth between now and 24 hours after we hit $5k (this gives you a chance to save on gas fees). While we certainly appreciate generous donations, any donation is welcome ASSUMING gas + your donation exceeds $10 (This is honestly about spam reduction). Donations can be sent on mainnet to Ethstaker.eth. If you prefer to donate through another channel, just comment below and we'll look into it.

> As you may know, EthStaker is a non-profit group with the primary goal of improving access to staking for everyone and improving decentralization of the beacon chain - but even though we don't profit from EthStaker, we still need cash to make things happen. EthStaker is me \[/u/superphiz\],

> We work closely with /u/worthalter, but he has moved on to focus on POAP development.

> Let me be superphiz for a minute: I love giving out POAPs and I hate taking money. I WILL accept money for EthStaker because it benefits all of us, and I want everyone to enjoy POAP. If you get butthurt by this kind of thing please keep in mind that our only goal is community service. There is no personal gain here.

> This is the first announcement of this, I'm sure things will evolve as we get closer.
